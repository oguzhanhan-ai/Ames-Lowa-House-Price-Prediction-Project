## Business Problem

A machine learning project is desired to predict the prices of different types of houses using a dataset that contains features of each house and their respective prices.

## Dataset Story

The dataset consists of housing properties in Ames, Iowa, and includes 79 explanatory variables. You can access the dataset and competition page on Kaggle using the link below. Since it's from a Kaggle competition, there are two separate CSV files: one for training and another for testing. The test dataset has empty values for house prices, which you are expected to predict.
